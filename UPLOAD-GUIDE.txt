1. Open FileZilla, Cyberduck, or your FTP client
2. Connect to: www.simongrant.org
3. Navigate to your web directory
4. Drag and drop the 4-6 files listed above

From your terminal, run:

cd /home/user/2026-Claude-trial

scp index.html app.js question-data.js styles.css api.php \

Then SSH to your server and create the data directory:

AFTER UPLOADING:
